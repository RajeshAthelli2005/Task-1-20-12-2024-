    <h2><u>HTML :</u></h2>
    <p>HTML was originally developed by Computer scientist Tim Berners-Lee while he was working
        at CERN (European Organization for Nuclear Research) and he also developed Browser.
        HTML can be abbreviated as Hyper Text Markup Language it is the standard markup language
        used to create web pages along with CSS and some Scripting Languages. HTML is the basic
        technology used to create web pages as well as to create user interfaces for mobile and web
        applications.</P>

    <p>CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets it specifies the rules for the organizing elements of a web
        pages here different elements are like font, paragraph, heading etc all these elements are declared
        at one place and can be applied to entire web page or any selected area in the web page.
        The main use of CSS on the web page is to reduce the HTML coding for each element on the page
        and to determine the style and layout of the web pages by doing this it also reduces the file size of
        the web document. CSS also controls spaces between the elements.</P>

        Designed to enable responsive development of mobile-first websites, Bootstrap provides a collection of syntax
        for template designs.Bootstrapping is a statistical procedure that resamples a single dataset to create many
        simulated samples.</p>
    <h2><u>JAVA SCRIPT :</u></h2>
    <p>The original name of JavaScript was “LIVE SCRIPT” it was originally created by Netscape and
        Sun Microsystems. The Microsoft version of JavaScript is called JS Script.

        provide functionality such as password protection and browser detection and it display information
        such as the current time, date on the web page. It is light weight interpreted programming language
        with object oriented capabilities.
        It is an interpreted language does not required compilation. It is a loosely coded language i.e., one
        data type can be automatically converted into another data type it also supports event based

    <h2><u>GITHUB :</u></h2>
    <p>Git is not the same as GitHub.
        GitHub makes tools that use Git.

        In this tutorial, we will focus on using Git with GitHub.</p>
    <h2><u>SQL</u></h2>
    <p>Structured query language (SQL) is a programming language for storing and processing information in a relational
        database. A relational database stores information in tabular form, with rows and columns representing different
        data attributes and the various relationships between the data values. You can use SQL statements to store,
        update, remove, search, and retrieve information from the database. You can also use SQL to maintain and
        optimize database performance.</p>
    <h2><u>REACT JS :</u></h2>
    <p>React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.
        React is a tool for building UI components.Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a

        DOM.</p>
    <h2><u>REDUX</u></h2>
